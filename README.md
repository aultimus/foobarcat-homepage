Github Pages for my foobarcat.com homepage

## Running locally

From the project root, you can serve the site with Python's built-in HTTP server:

```bash
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Then open `http://localhost:4000/` in your browser.

## Aesthetic Direction
The current minimal site is correct for now. When you do invest effort, aim for:

### Palette
Deep charcoal / near-black base, warm off-white text, muted brass or deep blue accents. Avoid pure black and pure white.

### Texture
Very subtle pattern overlays (Deco geometry or Victorian wallpaper abstraction) only visible on large screens or hover states. Almost subliminal.

### Typography
Modern serif or restrained geometric sans. Avoid playful fonts. Type should feel architectural.

### Imagery
Engineering, infrastructure, navigation, cities, systems diagrams, travel, architecture — not generic tech imagery.

### Mood
Night train rather than airport lounge.

### Result
Minimal, but with depth rather than emptiness.
