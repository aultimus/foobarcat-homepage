Organisations can transform internally while the world continues to see the older version. Leadership changes, strategy evolves, culture adapts — yet external interpretation updates more slowly.

The same dynamic applies to individuals.

At any moment, a person exists in two forms: the internal self and the external signal that they emit. The self evolves continuously — through experience, practice and reflection. The signal lags behind.

Signal is composed of visible components that compress the complex self into legible forms. Roles are one such example that is infrequently updated and somewhat persistent. The role “doctor” immediately conjures connotations of competence, education and discernment. An individual may possess these traits without holding the title, yet without that socially legible container they are not easily recognised.

Signal is only an approximation of the self. Like any compression process, it is inherently lossy; aspects of the self may not survive the compression process.

Humans naturally evolve their internal self faster than they update their external signal. Careers shift, ambitions sharpen, values refine. But the signal components — clothing, presentation, public work — often remain aligned with an earlier version of the self. This is because **signal is a lagging indicator of the self**.

The self is high resolution, non-visible, and unique. Our ability to categorise an individual rapidly based on visible cues are efficient social heuristics that developed evolutionarily out of necessity over thousands of years. It is a valuable adaptation enabling rapid navigation of complex social environments.

Lag persists because internal change takes time and effort to propagate and translate into external signal. And because the process of compression and legible public expression can be risky. It risks social misinterpretation or revaluation which could result in a loss of social status. But if left unaddressed, that lag produces persistent misclassification.

Since lag is structural in nature, and signal components are low-fidelity, misclassification is therefore systemic and predictable. First impressions linger, earlier roles persist, and maturity outpaces old models. Whether this be in career, family structures or social circles, it can be costly when others allocate opportunity, responsibility and expectation based on outdated information.

Misclassification can be reduced by proactively addressing lag, by calibrating the external signal with the internal self. The individual can assume responsibility for the signal that they are emitting. Calibration is not automatic, but it can be engineered.

Given that misclassification can be reduced via calibration and that this can be approached as an engineering problem, the question arises: which signal components provide the highest leverage investment opportunities?

---

Few signal components are as persistent, visible, and voluntarily adjustable as dress. Unlike titles, roles or reputations, clothing is encountered immediately and repeatedly. It functions as a highly accessible, high-frequency, high-leverage component.

A white coat does not create competence, but it concentrates the perception of it. A high-visibility jacket does not grant authority, but it signals operational responsibility. Observers adjust behaviour accordingly. This equally applies to personal attire. Changes in perception can be engineered through sartorial selection.

While clothing has become cheap and accessible, with the industry incentivised towards novelty and turnover — advice has become fragmented and fashion driven. The end result is a vast catalogue with minimal curation, consumers fall back to the familiar and inertia accumulates.

---

The signal lags the self. Whilst signal will always be imperfect, it need not be outdated. Through deliberate calibration, signal lag and misclassification can be reduced.

Few domains are as accessible or offer as high leverage signal engineering as dress. Viewed structurally then, clothing is not vanity. It is calibration.

Sextant is an experiment in treating signal lag in style as an engineering problem.
