title: "The Failure of Fridge Futurism"

In 2007 I visited a university computer science department that I was considering joining. In one corner of the department sat a "kitchen of the future" — a small exhibition of prototypes and speculative domestic technologies that it was proposed, would sooner or later, become ubiquitous.

Kitchens, after all, have undergone genuine revolution. If you step inside a Victorian house, the living room and bedroom can still feel recognisable, desirable, even. The kitchen meanwhile, does not. Over the last century it has been transformed by refrigeration, electrification, plumbing, and a procession of labour-saving devices that dramatically reduced domestic toil. The kitchen is one of the clearest examples of technology reshaping everyday life. The kitchen then is no stranger to innovation.

Among the prototypes at the university was a 'smart fridge' — it could track inventory, it could suggest recipes, it could reorder milk. It was presented as the next logical step in that lineage of labour-saving innovation.

Yet within minutes of seeing it, I remember thinking: this won't catch on.

It wasn’t that the technology wouldn’t work. The fridge was technically impressive, it could scan, catalogue and automatically re-order items. It could even enumerate item combinations for recipes. The real issue is that it was solving the wrong problem.

The real modern pain point with groceries and cooking is not stock optimisation. The logistical pain of groceries was largely solved decades ago — by cars, supermarkets, and later online ordering. The pain today is not "I don't know if I have carrots" or "I have to go and get milk". The pain is: "What should I eat?", "Is this worth my time to cook given my constraints?" and "What aligns with my goals?". The fridge of the future isolated cooking from context.

The design did not centre agency. It attempted to automate decisions rather than clarify them. Some of the more recent success of meal kits is attributable to empowering decision-making alongside inventory optimisation.

**It fundamentally confused enumeration with intelligence**. Knowing you have 14 ingredients and that they can make a dozen recipes is not the same as knowing what you want to cook and how that aligns with your intentions, constraints or goals. It provided combinatorics, not curation.

Importantly, the onboarding friction was asymmetric and overwhelming. There was some attempt at automation, but it was still labour intensive. To work, it required immediate effort: scanning, ongoing maintenance, accurate tracking. The effort was front-loaded, meanwhile the payoff was deferred. It was high friction and low leverage.

Systems that misclassify identity problems as logistics problems often struggle to gain traction. Technology that multiplies options without trying to understand users deeply will struggle with adoption and user retention. In this way, enumeration is no substitute for discernment.

The same mistake appears whenever we try to make life 'smart' by tracking more, counting more, and optimising more — without asking what decision we are trying to make or what problem we are really trying to solve. The failure is centring data itself and not the decisions that it empowers.

Technical sophistication alone is not a reliable indicator of product success. A product’s leverage must outweigh the friction it introduces, and that leverage must be visible early. If value is gated behind a gauntlet of onboarding and data collection, adoption will stall.

These insights derived from the kitchen are applicable outside that room and even outside the home. They apply to a wide range of user-focused products. From smart home appliances, to productivity apps, to health trackers. Value propositions must align with real friction and identity-level leverage. And any system that reduces life to counting without clarity will ultimately fail to resonate with users.

So, the future may not be smart fridges, but it's systems that centre user identity, provide judgement, and balance leverage with friction.

In 2026 I still buy my own milk. And I for one, am ok with that.
